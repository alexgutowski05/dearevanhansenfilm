					Dear Evan Hansen tells the story of a young man with a social anxiety 
					disorder who so yearns to make a connection with his peers that he fabricates 
					a relationship with a deceased student to become closer to the boy’s family. 
					When a classmate commits suicide, shy Evan Hansen finds himself at the center 
					of the tragedy and turmoil. In a misguided attempt to comfort the boy’s 
					grieving family, Evan pretends that he was actually good friends with their 
					son. He invents a fabricated email account to “prove” their friendship, and 
					when a fake suicide note makes its way online, Evan finds himself the 
					unintended face of a viral video about loneliness and friendship. As his 
					social currency skyrockets, Evan is drawn deeper and deeper into the lie. 
					His relationship with his actual mother wanes in comparison to that of his 
					“shiny new family.” He finally lands the girl of his dreams, and most 
					importantly--he’s no longer invisible. Eventually, Evan is forced to make 
					a decision: Will he give himself over to the fantasy he’s created, or will 
					he bite the bullet and risk losing everything he’s ever wanted? With a 
					fast-paced new score from fresh young songwriting duo Pasek and Paul, 
					(not to mention a few Tony awards), Dear Evan Hansen has become an instant 
					hit among theatergoers everywhere. &nbsp; <span id="cite">Information from
